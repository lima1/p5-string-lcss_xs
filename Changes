Revision history for Perl extension String::LCSS_XS.

1.3 Sun Aug 15 2010 
    - added github repository
    
1.2 Tue Mar 2 2010 
    - Bugfix: * Segfault when one string is undef (thanks Louis-David, closes
                 #55147)
                 
1.1 Mon Feb 8 2010 
-  Patch from ikegami (thank you so much :-) ):
     *  Uses appropriate #defines for types rather than "int".
     *  No longer allocates C structures to pass info from the .c to the .xs
     *  Implements the swapping a comment said should be done.
     *  No longer keeps track of all matches if the user only wants one.
     *  Uses a more efficient means of extracting multiple matches from UTF8=1
        strings.
     *  No longer warns for bad UTF8=1 strings (I think). It used to warn
     *  multiple times.
     *  Uses safer utf8n_to_uvchr instead of utf8_to_uvchr
