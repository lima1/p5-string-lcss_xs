=head1 NAME

String::LCSS_XS - Find The Longest Common Substring of Two Strings.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes String::LCSS_XS version 1.3

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use String::LCSS_XS qw(lcss lcss_all);
  
  my $longest = lcss ( "zyzxx", "abczyzefg" );
  print $longest, "\n";

  my @result = lcss ( "zyzxx", "abczyzefg" );
  print "$result[0] ($result[1],$result[2])\n";

  my @results = lcss_all ( "ABBA", "BABA" );
  for my $result (@results) {
     print "$result->[0] ($result->[1],$result->[2])\n";
  }

  $longest = lcss ( "foobar", "abcxyzefg", 3 ); #undef

=head1 DESCRIPTION

String::LCSS_XS computes the Longest Common Substring of two strings s and t.
It is a C implementation of L<String::LCSS> and uses a dynamic programming 
algorithm with O(mn) runtime and O(min(m,n)) memory usage (m is the length of s 
and n the length of t). 

=head1 EXPORT_OK 

By default String::LCSS_XS does not export any subroutines. The subroutines
defined are
  
=over

=item lcss(s, t, min)

In scalar context, returns the first found longest common substring of s and
t. In array context, it also returns the match positions. Mainly for
compatibility with L<String::LCSS>. The optional argument min defines the
minimum length of a reported substring.

=item lcss_all(s, t, min)

Returns all longest common substrings of s and t including the match positions.

=head1 PERFORMANCE

  my $s = 'i pushed the lazy dog into a creek, the quick brown fox told me to';
  my $t = 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog';

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-string-lcss_xs@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org>. 

L<String::LCSS> returns C<undef> when the lcss has size 1. String::LCSS_XS
returns this single character. This is a limitation of L<String::LCSS>.
